# Arch Linux: Primitive Mirror Updater

Spoiler alert, this package could be under your expectations. Why? It is a very primitive way to get the best mirror's server from your country. Obviously, if you are living in the USA, Germany, Czechia, Hong Kong, France or other country with the best number of servers and connections to the WWW (World Wide Web), I am confident that you don't have problems with update your Arch Linux. On the other hand, in countries as mine (Mexico) [the official stats][Arch Linux mirrors status] of the best connection are out of the reality. Download the packages take a long time, keeping in mind that I have an Internet with 200 Mb/s of download and 50 Mb/s of upload. A solution is taking randomly the best servers and check what are the faster with a primitive process. I install a [package][0ad-data] and get how much real time it took, then I remove this [package][0ad-data] and start again but with other servers, I repeat this steps for 3 or 4 servers.
