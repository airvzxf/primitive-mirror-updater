# Arch Linux: Primitive Mirror Updater

Spoiler alert, this package could be under your expectations. Why? It is a very primitive way to get the best mirror's server from your country. Obviously, if you are living in the USA, Germany, or other country with the best number of servers and connections to the WWW (World Wide Web), I am confident that you don't have problems with update your Arch Linux. In other hand, countries as mine (Mexico), it is not working [the official stats][Arch Linux mirrors status] of the best connection because at the end, when the packages are download it takes a long time. A solution is taking randomly the best servers and check what are the best with a primitive process. I install a [package][0ad-data] and get how much real time it took, then I remove this [package][0ad-data] and start again but with other servers, I repeat this steps for 3 or 4 servers and get the best of the best.
